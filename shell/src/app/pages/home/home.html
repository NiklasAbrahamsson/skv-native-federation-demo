      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>
        This shell application is the <strong>host</strong>. It handles
        authentication, navigation, and orchestration. Sub-applications are
        loaded at runtime via <code>loadRemoteModule</code> using
        Native Federation.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Independent deployment</h2>
      <p>
        Each sub-app is built and deployed separately. The shell reads
        <code>federation.manifest.json</code> at startup to discover remote
        entry points. No rebuild of the shell is needed when a sub-app
        is redeployed.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Shared singleton services</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>AuthService</code> from <code>&#64;skv/shared</code> is a
        singleton across the entire federation. Log in here in the shell
        and navigate to the sub-app — it will see the same authenticated user.

    Use the navigation above to visit the <strong>Sub-App</strong> section.
    Try logging in first to see the shared auth state in action.
